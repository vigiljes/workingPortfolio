My work spans beyond the screen‚Äîit's about connecting the dots between design and engineering to create seamless, impactful experiences. I bring a hands-on approach to the table, using tools like Figma to wireframe intuitive layouts and conducting comprehensive user research to understand needs and behaviors.

It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but the process taught us just how effective AI can be in accelerating digital product creation when time is short.",
    desc3: "Users log in and start exploring. The system analyzes mood-based factors like time, weather, genre, song key, and pitch, then suggests tracks that match the moment. It doesn‚Äôt interfere with Spotify‚Äôs native playlist system‚Äîit works alongside it, serving as a test space for discovery that could, over time, refine a person‚Äôs listening habits.",
    desc5: "The app worked‚Äîbut the mood detection? That‚Äôs where things could‚Äôve been sharper. Given more time, deeper user research and AI assistance could‚Äôve fine-tuned the recommendation engine, making it feel less like an algorithm and more like a true personal assistant for music discovery.",
    desc6: "With little time, limited assets, and no graphic design expertise, we kept the visuals simple but made sure the concept shined. The project showed that when time is short, you have to focus on core interactions and embrace iteration. Even as a rough prototype, the potential was there‚Äîa functional case study proving that the intersection of AI, music, and UX design is something worth exploring further.",
